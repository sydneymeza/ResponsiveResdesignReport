      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Imagine you're in a small town and you work for the local government.
        You want your community to have easy access to resources that they might
        need. Such as paying their bills, or registering to become a member of
        the local Native American tribe. The current website is currently hard
        for people to navigate, and sometimes read. While it has all the
        information it isn't very accessible and doesn't have high contrast in
        some parts of the website. There's also a huge problem where its
        unaccessible on a moblie device, or a tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to redesign the Menominee Indian Tribe's website because one of
        the huge issues they had was that their website was not responsive.
        Resizing even the web browser caused problems as text started to
        overlap. There were also some problems with contrast, or some design
        aspects that just didn't make sense. I hoped to better this design,
        hopefully make it a bit more cohesive, and a bit easier to navigate. The

      <h1>Usability Issues</h1>
      <p>
        While searching for websites to redesign, I knew that Native American
        tribes would most likely not have the best designers. While I was
        surprised by some tribal sites having well designed websites there were
        many that did not. It's important to upkeep these sites because the
        people in the tribe still need current access to the resources that are
        available.
      </p>
      <div class="photos">
        <img alt="image of the Menominee website in the full desktop screen only contrast and some other design choices look off" src="/assets/site.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        The first problem that stuck out to me was that the website wasn't
        responsive. Simply resizing the browser caused the text to overlap, or a
        photo to block the entire page. Another flaw I noticed was that there
        were two nav bars. I thought that they were both necessary, but the way
        that the nav bars were stacked on top of each other was a bit unnerving
        and not very intuitive to use, and I was confused as to which nav bar
        would have the information that I wanted. It didn't have a clear
        hierarchy. Throughout the page I was a bit confused on what I could or
        couldn't click, and I was even surprised by a button.
      </p>
      <div class="photos">

      </div>      
      <p>
        As I inspected the code I also noticed that there wasn't an alt tag for
        any of the photos on the website, thus making it not very screenreader
        friendly. The website did use HTML tags, which is important, and I'm
        glad that they did. Based on these problems, I knew that I could fix a
        few of them to make the website a bit more user friendly.

      <h1>Visual Redesign</h1>
      <p>
        To redesign this website I first started by speed sketching nine
        different ideas, I took about a minute for each skecth. I struggled a
        bit with this activity, but I did learn from it. I found that I was
        constantly getting stuck at the beginning, and a little bit at the end,
        but with I was sketching the middle sketches I found myself exploring
        other ideas even if they weren't the more user friendly, or if they
        didn't make sense at all. At least it was an idea. By the end of it I
        did enjoy the sketching, and I also enjoyed creating my final sketch
        from these speed sketches. I tried to take all my best ideas to redesign
        the website.
      </p>
      <div class="photos">

        <img alt="image of a handdrawn final sketch. It is messy but a more well thought out idea than the sketches" src="/assets/final_sketch.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        After making my final sketch I started on wireframing. I didn't really
        struggle with this, so I know that there is room for improvement. They
        look quite, rough, but they are low fidelity sketches. I found myself
        really being able to sit down and think about each screen that I was
        designing for. I know that it took me a bit of time to decide how each
        screen size should look, especially because before this excersize I
        didn't really pay attention to the actual size difference between a
        tablet and a desktop. I've always just imagined the tablet to be a
        slightly scaled down version of a desktop, but it's really not. I know
        that this information will help me as I continue to creat more
        interfaces.

      <p>
        It was a bit difficult to create the Style Guide for this website. I
        knew what colors I would like to use, but I was afraid that the contrast
        would not be the best. I was able to use AudioEye online to help see
        which colors would be worse to use, and I hope that overall the contrast
        with the new website isn't terrible. I also had a lot of fun creating
        this style guide. I thought it was very fun creating elements that I
        could use in my website, and just playing around on Figma. I have grown
        to enjoy Figma a lot, and hope to always get better at using it. I think
        that I may have not included everything in the Style Guide because the
        website page I chose didn't use that many. I didn't include variations
        of italics, different font weights, and I wasn't able to create many
        icons because the page I chose didn't use them.
      </p>
      <div class="photos">
        <img alt="a screenshot of a Figma frame. There are 6 colors, all various shades of green and blue. There are multiple iterations of buttons, how text should look, and how certain dropdown menu's/navbars would look." src="/assets/style_guide.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>
        Creating the High Fideltiy Mockups was my favorite part of the
        assignment. I was really able to put my figma skills to use. I think
        that using Figma is my favorite way to actually get my ideas out into
        the world. While creating my mockups I did find that I would have to
        change some parts of my style guide, I also found that I wanted to
        change some things from my wireframes. I felt like this was the last
        chance to make any huge changes, and while I didn't make any too drastic
        changes, I didn't change a few things, which I am happy that I did
        before working on the actual redesign.

      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoyed using CSS and HTML to make the website, but I did run into
        some problems, or setbacks, when I was actually coding the site. I
        wanted to do more than what I could actually code. I have past
        experience with CSS, but as I was looking at my designs I knew that I
        would have to consult the internet for help. This learning process was
        very helpful because I learned more about CSS and the different
        properties that I can change with CSS. I also found it a bit frustrating
        not being able to figure out some bugs. Overall I think that I had a
        great experience with redesigning the website. I think some issues that
        I wasn't totally able to get rid of include the buttons not being
        totally responsive, and I believe that there might be some contrast
        errors. I had hoped to not have any contrast errors, but it seems that
        some colors were not caught with the online sources I used. I know that
        I could have also used a better way to have the text be responsive. I
        felt like I didn't do it correctly, or I did some of it correctly but I
        forgot to change other font sizes.
      </p>
      <div class="photos">
        <img src="/assets/redesign_sc.jpg" alt="screenshot of the redesigned page!">
      </div>

      <p>
        Some of the most important parts of my redesign include using consisten
        colors, and consistent fonts. I made it so that there is one clear
        important navigation bar that provides some hierarchy. It helps that its
        a sticky navbar, or it stays on the page no matter where the user
        scrolls. I also did help the website become more responsive because the
        tablet and phone screens have changed and will automatically resize as a
        user switches screens.

      <h1>Conclustion</h1>
      <p>
        I feel like I learned a lot from this project. I was able to get a lot
        of practice using Figma, and I was also able to practice my CSS skills.
        I fear that I have a long way to go to be proficient at using CSS, but I
        hope that in the future I will be able to have cleaner code that is
        easier to read. Again, my redesign can be found <a href="https://sydneymeza.github.io/ResponsiveRedesign/">here!</a>
